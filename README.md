# Parking Available Slots Detection

A computer vision project that uses machine learning to detect and classify available parking slots in real-time. This project helps drivers find available parking spaces quickly and efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time parking slot detection
- Machine learning-based classification of available/occupied slots
- Video processing capabilities
- Mask-based region of interest detection
- Support for high-resolution video input (1920x1080)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the demo)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yossefmohammed/Parking-availiable-slots.git
cd Parking-availiable-slots
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy jupyter
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook check_slots.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load the pre-trained model
   - Process video input
   - Detect available parking slots
   - View real-time results

## 📁 Project Structure
